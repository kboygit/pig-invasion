### Introduction

I hate crabs that pull other crabs!

In Pig Invasion, the player controls a pig that appears
at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the pig
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.
When the game begins, a fleet of crabs fill the sky and moves accross and
down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the crabs.If the player
shoots all the crabs, a new cast appears that moves faster than the previous cast.
If any crabs hits the player's pig or reaches the bottom of the screen,
the player loses a pig.If the player loses three pigs, the game ends.

### Inspired by (Crab Mentality)

Wherein the player(Pig) refuses to be looked down/stepped upon by the this kind of person's attitude.The Pig shoots them down using the 4P's where I call them the Piggy Piggy Pork Pork buster!.The pig hate this kind of mentality common among a certain people.

Definition of Crab Theory:

        Crabs in a bucket can easily escape from the bucket one at a time, but instead of doing that they pull each other down whenever one rises to the top - thus insuring their collective demise.

        This is analogous to the behavior of a person who diminishes or pulls down anyone else who achieves or is about to achieve success greater than their own.
        Crab mentality: We all like to see our friends get ahead, but not too far ahead.

        If I can't have it, no one can have it.
